<p>1. create a variable and place an input statement to get the username from the device user</p>
<p>2. create another variable and place an input statement to get the password from the user</p>
<p>3. create another variable and palce an input statement to get the cofirmation of password for the password created by the user</p>
<p>4. create a conditional statement to comfirm the password created by the user by comparing the variable of the password and the variable for the confirmation of the password</p>
<p>5. inside the conditional statement under the else statement create a while loop when the passsword inputed for confirmation of password does not correspond with the password created by the user for it to re-run asking for the correct password</p>

<p>Following same step following to create the register</p>

<p>9. create a conditional statement to comfirm the login password created by the user by comparing the variable of the login password and the variable for the confirmation of the login password</p>
<p>10. inside the conditional statement under the else statement create a while loop when the login passsword inputed for confirmation of login password does not correspond with the login password created by the user for it to re-run asking for the correct login password</p>
